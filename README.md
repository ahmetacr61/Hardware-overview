# Hardware-overview
Small HTML/CSS/JS Project to create a website in which you can be redirected to some youtube-links to find more about Hardware in a computer. You can freely use my code, just give me a visible credit on the webside (can be in a corner, just so that you can read it), but it is not very optimized, it's a just for fun project and the Youtube Videos are NOT from me. Also the pictures that I used for this page are just some examples from google and i would recommend you to use your own pictures because these can be images which aren't free to use.
